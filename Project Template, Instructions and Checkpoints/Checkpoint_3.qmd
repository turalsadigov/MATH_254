1.  Fully implement the feedback you got from Checkpoint 2.
2.  `Section 2c:` Start describing the methods you will be using in your
    project. Make the methods as clear as possible so that the reader
    can reproduce exactly what you describe. You might update this
    section as research progress.
3.  `Section 3:` Have some preliminary results. This section will be
    updated in the next checkpoint.
4.  `Section 5:` Update the reference section as you use more resources.
5.  `Section 6:` You may want to update the appendix section if you have
    more to be included here.
